Instance: Adams' Family

# Little weird for my example.. Initial Attributes
are before a reservation is made. Method changes them

Attributes:
number_in_party = 4
name_of_party = 'Adam'
amount_charged = 0
number_of_infants = 0
amount_tipped = 0
reservation = false

Methods:
make_reservation:
  reservation = true
  name_of_party = 'Adam'
  number_in_party = 4
count_tipped: amount_tipped = 25.00
total_payment: 212.43 + 25.00 = 237.43
charge: amount_charged = 212.43
